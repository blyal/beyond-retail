            Software Engineers remain among the most sought-after professionals.
            At the same time, programming is one of the most accessible skills
            to learn—all you need is a computer and an internet connection. As a
            developer, you will draw a decent salary (especially if you work on
            your subsidiary abilities, such as interview, presentation, and
            negotiation skills). The career also opens possibilities for
            travel—in terms of both business travel and relocation.

            I don’t want to give too much CV-building advice. There’s countless
            resources online for that. I would only suggest, keep it relatively
            short, and cut the irrelevant stuff that tech companies will be
            uninterested in. If, for example, you have a philosophy degree or
            worked as a hotel manager, you might include those as they suggest
            good qualities such as analytical thinking and responsibility. But,
            if you worked for a year as an Uber driver, consider excluding that.
            No disrespect at all to Uber drivers, but a CV is a cultivated
            self-presentation to potential employers in specific fields. They
            don&apos;t need your life story, they need to know why they should
            hire you for this job over the next guy.

            I have found almost all my software engineering jobs through
            LinkedIn. A LinkedIn profile is an avatar of your professional self,
            so take a bit of time to deck it out. Get a professional photo
            taken. Find and add any contacts you have on LinkedIn. Add any of
            your past skills and awards to your page, as well as your newfound
            coding skills. Use LinkedIn’s free month of Premium and do a few
            coding courses on their education platform, which will land you some
            certificates that you can directly display on your profile. Having a
            good LinkedIn profile is underrated.

            The main challenge with your CV/LinkedIn is that they are needed for
            applying for jobs, but before you’ve had a (relevant) job,
            there&apos;s not much to include on them. This is where the
            accreditation comes in handy, as it is something to include.
            Furthermore, many accreditation programs will allow you the chance
            to build an app as part of a team, sometimes for an external
            company, which is kind of like an unpaid job or internship. It’s a
            good start CV-wise, and could be a leg-up into the professional
            world.

            With software, unpaid relevant work is never really unpaid: the
            payment is the advancements in terms of learning and experience you
            make, the positive reference from your manager, and the entry on
            your CV.

            There’s no real time that is too early to start applying to work at
            companies. Even if you have no experience, the worst thing that can
            happen when you apply to a company is that they say no. Work for
            free, if you have to. The thing you need is experience and new
            skills—as I mentioned, think of those as the payment. Trust me, it
            will be worth it.

            When applying for jobs, LinkedIn has been my first port-of-call.
            Stay open to other channels as well though, because there are a lot
            of them (and the usefulness of a given platform may depend on your
            location).

            Something you need to know when starting with job applications is
            that, even for more experienced developers, the vast majority of
            applications are rejected. So don’t fear rejection. It may hurt, but
            you will get used to it, because you will receive so many that
            eventually you will just get bored of it. Similarly, unless you have
            a rare talent for interviewing, get used to the experience of having
            a bad interview. It’s similar to a comedian bombing onstage—happens
            to all, including the very best. It’s not a big deal, just try to
            use it as a chance to learn how to do a tiny bit better in the next
            one.

            Keep going. Keep applying. Keep refining your approach, the way you
            present yourself, your CV and your LinkedIn. If you feel like things
            are just not coming together, aim lower. Approach a company, explain
            your situation, and offer to work for a while part-time for free.
            Remember, you are building skills and building a profile. One small
            win, one small project, one small internship—they all put you in a
            better position, slightly more likely to be able to progress. It’s
            hard work. But remember, this is the hard part. Be the person who
            can do hard things. If it was easy, everyone would do it.

            the job. If you commit to this first job, knowing you will be far
            from perfect, but just keep showing up, over time you will watch
            yourself improving. You will gradually understand more, know what to
            do in more situations, participate in successful projects, create
            working software that companies actually use to run their business.
            Your managers will also see you improving, slowly-but-surely.
